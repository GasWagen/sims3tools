# sims3tools
sims3tools provides a set of tools for the Sims3 modder, based around the s3pi library. It includes:
* a package editor (s3pe), which allows most useful resources to be edited
* an Object / CAS Part cloner (s3oc) for creating a base for modifications
* a sims3pack packer/unpacker (s3su), which simplifies handling the content of these files
* a string table editor (s3se) for allowing string table resources to be efficiently edited

plus a number of additional utilities.

Imported from http://sourceforge.net/projects/sims3tools/, because SVN, and SF in particular, is garbage. Official development on this project by pljones have ended, and as of right now, I don't have any plans to continue it.
